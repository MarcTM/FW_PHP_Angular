# MARC PROJECT 1DAW <br> PHP FRAMEWORK & ANGULARJS

In this project, I'll be using a PHP Framework for the backend, and AngularJS for the frontend.
This project consists on a supplement webpage I developed before without using these frameworks, and now I'm migrating it into these PHP framework and AngularJS framework.

## Features
-Homepage (Carousel, Categories, More visited) <br>
-Contact (You can contact with the webpage administrator) <br>
-Shop (You can see all the products with an AngularJS pagination) <br>
-Log in (You can register, log in your account, and recover your password) (Implementation of JWT token) <br>
-Favorites (You can add the products to favorites by clicking a hearth icon, so it will become red)
-Cart (You can add products to your cart. If there is no account logged, they will remind there in localstorage until you log in. If you are logged you can change the quantity and see the total price)
